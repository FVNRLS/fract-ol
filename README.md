# fract-ol

<br>**About The Project**

Project based on library MiniLibX, to discover or use the mathematical notion of complex numbers, to take a peek at the concept of optimization out computer graphics and practice event handling.


<br>**Getting Started**

_to compile the program on Mac:_
<br>`make all`
<br><br>_to compile the program on Linux:_
<br> 
* download and install minilibx for Linux
* extract the minilibx folder from /libs and delete all references to it in  Makefile and headers

<br>**Prerequisites**

* Installed C compiler like gcc, cc or clang.
* installed or compiled minilibx

<br>**Usage**

<br>**Roadmap**

1) Resolve slow 🐢 zooming (in and out) and moving of the fractal:
* pre-calculate the rendering before initial rendering
* define sufficient but not too high number of iterations for each fractal separately

2) Add more features:

* change Julia shape depending on the mouse coordinate by clicking and moving the mouse pointer around the window 
* support changing fractal sharpness with hotkeys
* support more (maybe all?) colors from the library https://htmlcolorcodes.com/colors/
* add persistent fluent fractal animation
